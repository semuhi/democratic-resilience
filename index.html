            <h1>About the Project</h1>
            <p>
                Funded by the SSHRC, Canada, This project assesses the degree of global democratic decline in recent decades and explores why democracy has persisted in 
              so many countries despite the rise of populist forces and an increasingly hostile international environment. Drawing on different original datasets, statistical analyses, 
              and detailed case studies, the project expects to show that such resilience is grounded in two factors: economic development and authoritarian weakness.

                <p>
                    While capitalism today is widely seen as a threat to democracy, the free market plays a central role in fostering pluralism. A strong and autonomous private sector is critical to the creation of a robust opposition and an independent civil society that are central to democratic resilience. At the same time, even rich and powerful private sectors in high-income countries may be vulnerable to government pressure with regulatory coercion — a fact that makes these countries potentially susceptible to democratic backsliding. Indeed, state capture of business — to a greater degree than business capture of the state — represents the most direct threat to democratic survival.

                <p>
How does resource concentration impact regime survival? On the one hand, the concentration of resources in government hands may allow dictators to weaken independent economic actors, bind large numbers to the state through the provision of attractive public employment, and facilitate efforts to impoverish, coopt, or divide organized opposition. On the other hand, high-level state involvement in the economy may render autocrats liable for a country’s economic woes and aggravate the economic loss of the incumbent elite during economic downturns, leading to higher rates of defection. To test these ideas, we created an original index of resource concentration that includes a variety of measures for the relative size of the government/private sector, state’s coercive control over the economy, and poverty and underdevelopment with a country-year-level dataset from 1970-2023. We show that higher levels of statist resource concentration significantly boost regime survival, controlled for the level of institutionalization. The findings have significant implications for understanding structural/political economy factors behind regime durability.
